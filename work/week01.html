            <p>Having finished 3 tests, but half of which have been negligated.</p>
            
            <h3 id="Monday">Day 1</h3>
            <p>Coalescing data in table base_play from September to Octorber all day as C and J told me.
               Set the smallfiles.avgsize as the integer times of the blocksize, e.g. 128MB or 256MB.

               <code class="highlighter-rouge">set hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize=256000000;</code></p>
            <p>Hive performs better than Spark. I haven't find the reason.</p>
    
            <h3 id="Tuesday">Day 2</h3>
            <p>Build my blog in Github as Wang Yin's style. Simple and clear, I fancy that template, it looks like 
               a documentary.
            </p>
    
            <h3 id="Wednesday">Day 3</h3>
            <p>I decide to learn Java. Though I refused studying it after the interviewer of MS declined me and 
                suggested me to learn Java on the intern interview 4 years ago. I gradually realize one can't escape, if you really want to
                do something. You'll meet them just on the corner. So just accept challeges now.
            </p>
            <p>Fine, good news is I will get to know how to distinguish JDK, JRE and JVM soon. Maybe make some interesting 
                regression models to participate in kaggle. Lost in my daydream.
            </p>
            <p>Besides, I read Hive Programming. It's a really nice book. Many suspended questiones of mine are solved 
                after reading the first 50 pages. Very wholesome for. I plan to continue reading it tommorrow. No big deals
                today.
            </p>
    
            <h3 id="Thursday">Day 4</h3>
            <p>I continue reading Advanced Programming in Hive. Can't find a question difficult enough to ask for a help.
                Sometimes you have to go straight to face, because troubles you thought can escape will finally encounter
                with you. Thus don't wait until that happen. Choose when you can choose, it won't be that horrible as you 
                imagine.
