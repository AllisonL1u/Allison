            <h2>Trials on Week01</h2>
            <p>Having finished 3 tests, but half of which have been negligated. Thus this is written in English.</p>
            
            <h3 id="Monday">Day 1</h3>
            <p>M and J are both absented for work. I feel bored and sad. Inertionless.</p>
            <p>It's funny, I thought J doesn't want to answer my question because there was no answer 
               for nearly an hour after I send messages to him. But later, I was reminded that 
               M asked for a day off today, but her profile was the same as usual. That's to say, 
               maybe J asked for a day off today too, but the system hadn't shown it. Then I checked 
               J's profile and I found he asked a day off too. And I sended another message to him, to tell him
               that I know , then I closed the window in relief. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="Tuesday">Day 2</h3>
            <p>M and J both come to work today. I feel no better than yesterday. Cause I know M is leaving 
            in a few weeks. So depressed. A friend you have met for several months will be away soon.
            </p>
            <p>While J answered my question yesterday at 08:44 a.m. So early. Maybe he just open the app, and reply
            to me immediately. While I saw that reply an hour later. Cause I always get up at 8:08 a.m. and 
            spend around 40 minutes to prepare before setting off to company. And I arrive at 9:30 usually.
            I hestate for a while, want to say sth valueble for him. But only pale words. I feel weak and unconfident
            so I just talk trials and finish the talk soon. I'd like to talk to J everyday cause I always pick up sth
            from his words, while now I'm not that relaxed as before.
