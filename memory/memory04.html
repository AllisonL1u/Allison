            <h2>Trials on Week04</h2>
            <p>Haven't been studied for around a week, that's totally wrong. Go back to right track this week. 
            There's no more than 60 days left. So soon.</p>
            
            <h3 id="Wednesday">Day 3</h3>
            <p>M told me that J asked several days off for the trip to Japan. Cause she found pics of Japanese 
            scenary in C's Moments. Besides], there's no persons shown in the pics. Thus she can't conjecture
            from photos whether he went there alone or with others. Fine. I just hope there's no girls with him.
            Or there's no other girls in his mind except me. Silly me. XD </p>
            
            <h3 id="Thursday">Day 4</h3>
            <p>I want to talk with him. Though I have forgotten how he looks like. Sigh slightly. 
            After I took a cup of startbuck for him, I have less talks with him recently. I don't want to
            bother him. But I still want to talk with him. Comparing to talk through IM, I prefer to have
            conversations with him face to face. It helps me learn more about reality rather than stay in my
            inner world made with imagination. How can I create the chance?</p>
